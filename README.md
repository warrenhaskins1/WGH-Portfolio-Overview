# WGH-Portfolio-Overview

## Description

- With the desire to get a better understanding of some fundamentals of html/css as well as some of the more advanced features, I have designed my first Web Portfolio.

- There was much to learn, and there still is....Some of the standouts are the usage of Flex-Box, Media Queries and psuedo-classes. The amount of tools at our disposal utilizing css are vast.
